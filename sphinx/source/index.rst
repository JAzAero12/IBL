Welcome to IBL's documentation!
================================

**IBL** is a Python library to model the viscous effects on surfaces using the
integral boundary layer method. This method is intended for flows with
relatively thin boundary layers that are attached. It takes an inviscid boundary
layer edge velocity (in a variety of forms) along with some configuration
settings and will calculate the corresponding wall shear stress, transpiration
velocity, and other parameters based on the model used.
