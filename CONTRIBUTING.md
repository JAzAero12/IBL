### Python Code

For Python code, we follow the *Style Guide for Python Code*, [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
Code should should produce no warning when analyzed by [pycodestyle](https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/).
In addition the code should produce no messages from [Pylint](https://pylint.org/).
These should be checked before committing code, and most IDEs support these.
Both of these tools are common in most Python installations.
They are also available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org).
